This generates a custom save file for the cookie clicker game.

The original game can be found here: http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/.

DISCLAIMER: I don't really know how the game actually works, so the options are pretty limited. Maybe I'll add more options if I decide to play the game more.

Directions:

* <code>python cookiebreaker.py</code>
* Enter in whatever integer values you want at the prompts.
* Copy the save code.
* Play cookie clicker.
* Click "Menu" -> Click "Import save" -> Paste the save code -> Click "Okay"
